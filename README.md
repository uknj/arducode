#####Arduino Code as part of the University 2014-2015 Semester 1 Electronics and Instrumentation module (ENG 2090) for Mechanical Engineering.

#####Things to still do:
1. Comment Code.
2. Add overview of projects to the readme.
3. ~~Obtain and add pictures of the board.~~ See the img folder.
4. Add datasheet links for the components and the datasheets themselves potentially.

----

###Hardware Setup
All the code was tested on an [Arduino Leonardo](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardLeonardo) with a custom built shield to go on top of it. For the board schematic and the connection to pins refer to the BoardShematic.pdf file. The SurreyInstrumentBoard was (to the best of my knowledge) built buy [Professor Roger Webb](http://www.surrey.ac.uk/ati/ibc/people/roger_webb/). For pictures of the board, see the img folder.

One thing to note about the board is the infrared LED that is automatically activated on button press, this is to ensure that the photo-transistor which is located next to the infrared LED can register a light source when the button is pressed.

A motor is also used for one of the projects (MotorAccelControl) for pictures see the img folder.

###Overview of projects

Still to be done. Will do this ASAP.
